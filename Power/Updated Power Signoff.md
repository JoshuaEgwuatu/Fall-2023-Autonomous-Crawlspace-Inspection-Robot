# Function of the subsystem:
The team is going to improve the power subsystem. We need to increase the power output of the robot in order to allow it to navigate through more crawlspace environments. This will be achieved by checking the current power subsystem of the robot, determining the maximum power output capability of the existing system, and evaluating the power requirements for navigating through various crawlspace environments.

# Constraints:

- Physical limitations
  ** The robot's structure and components may have limitations on how much power they can handle or accommodate

- Energy source limitations
  ** The availability and capacity of the energy source used to power the robot may impose constraints on the power output

- Compatibility with existing systems
  ** The improved power subsystem should be compatible with the robot's existing systems and components
