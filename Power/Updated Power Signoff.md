# Function of the subsystem:
The team is going to improve the power subsystem we need to increasing the power output of the robot in order to allow it to navigate through more crawlspace environments by check the current power subsystem of the robot, determining the maximum power output capability of the existing system, and evaluating the power requirements for navigating through various crawlspace environments.
# Constraints:
# Analysis 
# Buildable Schematics
## CAD models
## Electrical Schematics
