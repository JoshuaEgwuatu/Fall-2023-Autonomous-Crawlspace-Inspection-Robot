# Function of the subsystem:
The funtion of this subsystem is to make mechaninical improvements to both the movement and power subsystems for the Crawlspace Inspection Robot to climb a 30 degree incline. The team will improve the power subsystem we need to increasing the power output of the robot in order to allow it to navigate through more crawlspace environments by check the current power subsystem of the robot, determining the maximum power output capability of the existing system, and evaluating the power requirements for navigating through various crawlspace environments. Through our new list of specifications and contraints, we can analyse a soltuion to the problem. 

# Constraints:

1- Physical limitations
   - The robot's structure and components may have limitations on how much power they can handle or accommodate
   - The device shall have rubber treading for more friction on inclined surfaces.
   - Main Chassie must have a low center of gravity for stability on the device.


 2- Energy source limitations
   -  The availability and capacity of the energy source used to power the robot may impose constraints on the power output
   -  Power rating of the subsystem should be lower output for better functionality.

3-  Compatibility with existing systems
   -  The improved power subsystem should be compatible with the robot's existing systems and components
