# Autonomous-Crawlspace-Inspection-Robot
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development. For a comprehensive guide to the repository set up see the bottom of the document.
## Executive Summary
Crawl spaces grant convenient access to the plumbing, duct work, and electrical wiring of a house, but they often present unique dangers to maintenance professionals and residents alike. Exposure to harsh breathing conditions, hanging obstacles, uncomfortable working positions, and even animals can cause non-ideal conditions. This capstone project will focus on the design and assembly of a robot prototype that can perform these inspections autonomously. The end product will be an autonomous, mobile robot that can be left unattended in a crawlspace by an inspector. It will navigate through the space, create a map and model of the space, compile an image of the entire crawlspace ceiling, and collect sensor data. This sensor data will include humidity, temperature, and wood moisture content.

## Current Iteration
This is the second iteration of the Croomba Project. As you look at the Github, you will see V1 and V2. These are the different iterations that have been done. We are currently on iteration V2.
