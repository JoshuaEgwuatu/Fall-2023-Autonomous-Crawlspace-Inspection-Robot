## What went well? 

- The compass subsystem performed well, providing accurate readings along the x, y, and z axes.
- The periodic calibration with the correction factor helped compensate for consistent bias and ensured accurate compass readings.
- The code for reading and calculating the compass heading was implemented correctly.
- The communication between the Arduino and Raspberry Pi was successful.
- The motor/chassis subsystem showed progress, with improvements in weight distribution and the ability to handle inclines up to 25 degrees.
- The change in design for the chassis and motors contributed to the goal of navigating various environments.
  
## What didn’t go well?
- The Croomba struggled to climb inclines above 25 degrees on the slick wooden surface, indicating a limitation in traction.
- The weight of the Croomba hindered its ability to climb a 30-degree incline on the carpet surface.

## What unanticipated problems occurred?
Two Arduinos being burned due to silly mistakes were unanticipated problems. it took me time to figure out that the boards are not working 

## What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
There are two subsystems, the Radon sensor and the live stream camera, that were not added to the system due to time constraints. If I were to do it over again, I would allocate more time and resources to incorporate these subsystems into the overall design

## What “best practices” have you identified?
- Regular calibration of the compass sensor to compensate for bias and enhance accuracy.
- Systematic testing and evaluation of the motor/chassis subsystem's performance on different surfaces and inclines.
- Effective communication and collaboration between team members.

## What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
- Double-check your work and be mindful of potential mistakes that could lead to damage.
- Take the necessary precautions to prevent hardware damage.
- Collaborate effectively as a team, leveraging each team member's strengths and expertise.

## What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone?
- Understanding and implementation of compass sensors.
- Calibration techniques to compensate for bias and enhance accuracy.
- Interpreting and analyzing compass readings.
- Writing Arduino code for sensor communication and data processing.
- Implementing communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi.


# Team 3: Joshua Egwuatu 

## What went well? The compass went really well. We were able to fix an issue the previous iteration had. The motor and chassis redesign also went as well. We were able to make vast improvements on our goal for a 30-degree incline.

## What didn’t go well?
The Croomba wasn't able to go up a 30-degree incline. We also weren't able to implement the live-stream subsystem and the radon subsystem.

## What unanticipated problems occurred?
The Arduino 2560 ended up burning, not allowing us to do any experimentation till we got a replacement. The radon sensor wasn't currently sold. Unable to find a suitable option within our time frame.

## What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?
I would make sure all group members are required to attend group meetings and make sure that we are all collaborating on each other's work. This is something we didn't start till later on and it would've payed off immediatley. 

## What “best practices” have you identified?
Collaboration is key, make sure you are properly communicating with teammates. Setup multiple meeting every week to insure group members are able to make some of the time slots. Properly document your work, it makes it easier for people to underdstand what you were trying to do.

## What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?
Do as much as you can during Capstone I. This will help your Capsstone II experience much easier! Set hard deadlines for teammates if possible, this helps keep people accountable.

## What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout capstone?
I was able to become a better communicator. I was also able to better understand terminal functions. Improved understanding of Arduino IDE. Gained more understanng on Buck converters. I was also able to improve soldering skills.
