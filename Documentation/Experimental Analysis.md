# Experimental Analysis

##  Compass:

### Explanation of the experimental design (what you did and what it was intended to measure)
The objective of this test is to verify the performance of the compass subsystem. The compass readings were obtained along the x, y, and z axes, which play a crucial role in navigation and orientation. The table below presents the recorded x, y, and z values for each measurement, providing insights into the performance of the compass subsystem.

### Data Table:
interpretation of the data (interpreting the data requires the writer to explain what the results of the experiments mean and an analysis of the cause of any unexpected results).    


## Motor

### Explanation of the experimental design (what you did and what it was intended to measure)
The motor subsystem can navigate steep inclines of up to 30 degrees and challenging environments. Motor encoders and advanced control algorithms ensure accurate speed measurement for real-time feedback.
