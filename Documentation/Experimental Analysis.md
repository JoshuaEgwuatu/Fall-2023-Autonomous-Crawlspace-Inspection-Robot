# Experimental Analysis

##  Compass Experiment:

### Experimental Design:
The objective of this test is to verify the performance of the compass subsystem. The compass readings were obtained along the x, y, and z axes, which play a crucial role in navigation and orientation. The table below presents the recorded x, y, and z values for each measurement, providing insights into the performance of the compass subsystem.

### Interpretation of the data:
Data Table:
 
| Measurement | Raw X | Raw Y | Raw Z |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1           | -34   | 14    | 149   |
| 2           | -32   | -66   | 147   |
| 3           | -103  | -50   | 121   |
| 4           | 15    | 32    | 138   |
| 5           | -80   | -89   | 117   |
| 6           | -82   | -97   | 115   |

- The first data point (1700025251.722397) shows relatively low values in the X-axis (-34) and Y-axis (14), with a moderate value in the Z-axis (149).
- The second data point (1700025254.742771) exhibits low values in the X-axis (-32) and Y-axis (-66), with a moderate value in the Z-axis (147).
- The third data point (1700025259.776896) displays a more negative value in the X-axis (-103) and a moderately negative value in the Y-axis (-50). The Z-axis value (121).
- The fourth data point (1700025261.790216) demonstrates a positive value in the X-axis (15) and a positive value in the Y-axis (32). The Z-axis value (138).
- The fifth data point (1700025264.810830) shows a negative value in the X-axis (-80) and a negative value in the Y-axis (-89). The Z-axis value (117).
- The sixth data point (1700025268.838013) exhibits a negative value in the X-axis (-82) and a negative value in the Y-axis (-97). The Z-axis value (115).

Overall, these data points are more representative of a stable magnetic field.
