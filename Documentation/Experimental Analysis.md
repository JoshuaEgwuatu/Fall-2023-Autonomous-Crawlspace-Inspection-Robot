# Experimental Analysis

##  Compass Experiment:

### Experimental Design:
The objective of this test is to verify the performance of the compass subsystem. The compass readings were obtained along the x, y, and z axes, which play a crucial role in navigation and orientation. The table below presents the recorded x, y, and z values for each measurement, providing insights into the performance of the compass subsystem.

- Raw X: This column represents the raw X-axis value measured by the compass.
- Raw Y: This column represents the raw Y-axis value measured by the compass.
- Raw Z: This column represents the raw Z-axis value measured by the compass.
- Heading: This column represents the heading angle in degrees, which indicates the direction the compass is pointing.

For each set of measurements, the values for Raw X, Raw Y, and Raw Z indicate the magnetic field strength along the respective axes. The Heading value indicates the angle in degrees relative to a reference direction  (north).

The compass readings were compared by rotating the compass in different directions and noting any deviations. The experiments conducted sufficiently established the value of the compass subsystem. 





## Motor/Chassis Experiment:

### Experimental Objective/Goal:
The objective of the motor/chassis experiment is to prove that the Croomba can navigate inclines of up to 30 degrees. Reaching this goal will prove that the Croomba is able to handle various environments, showing the versatility of the robot. To test this, the Croomba will navigate on both slick and carpet surfaces while on incline.

### Croomba Adjustments:
The Croomba has received updates to both the chassis and motor.

### Experimental Design/Procedure:
This experiment is conducted with materials found in our lab. Wooden planks are stacked up with a ramp to simulate an incline. Each plank added shows an incline increase of 5 degrees. An angle finder was used to confirm angle measurements. The robot will start at the beginning of a wooden slab and move until it has attempted to clear the incline. 10 Trials will be run for each incline. The first 5 trials will be on a slick wooden surface while the last 5 trials will be on a carpet-like surface.
