## Pictures
This directory contains the pictures taken throughout the testing and experimentation phases of the project. 
This includes the images used for stitching, maps generated by the lidar, and general pictures showing our progress through the design

The final test run performed in a real crawlspace environment can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYopD1X_bd8). 
While this presented some challenges not seen in the model crawlspace, it was a test beyond the scope of our original project proposal. It achieved navigation and mapping results consistent with our expectations. The stops robot makes during the test are to allow for picture taking as well as data collection. This will be essential when the moisture probe arm is added to the system.
